# [_dinQ_ - Find a court. Fast.](https://dinq.org/)

## Our inspiration
Before coming to Purdue, we loved playing pickleball at our local courts with friends. So, we wanted to continue that fun here on campus, but the CoRec's courts are always full! Outside or inside, night or day, the pickleball courts always have people playing. This inspired us to build an easier way to break into pickleball games.
## What _dinQ_ does
_dinQ_ allows players to queue into a facility-wide waitlist, ensuring that they will get a spot in a timely manner. Up to 4 people can queue as a group and choose between a 30-minute or 60-minute playtime. Once our app determines there is an available space on a court, the group from the top of the queue will be moved into that space. It's as easy as that!
## How we built _dinQ_
We built _dinQ_ to run as a local web app, so that facilities can run it on local devices, such as tablets or kiosks. _dinQ_ is built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and it stores its data in local storage. _dinQ_ can be run on any device with a browser, but its interface is best designed for a vertical screen, like a phone or tablet.
## Challenges we faced
We mainly had difficulty creating a fair and effective queuing system for the project. We were unsure if we should have added extra features like player ratings and specific court queues, but we ultimately decided to keep our idea concise.
## Accomplishments we're proud of
We are proud of our app's design and branding. We think _dinQ_ represents well in the dark green color palette, and the website's UX is quite polished for our expertise.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about functions and executing algorithms in JavaScript, alongside HTML/CSS. CSS has a lot of small design commands that can be used to tweak how the website looks, so we were able to experiment with that quite a lot to reach our final product. 
## What's next for _dinQ_
We hope to bring more features to _dinQ_ in the future, like specific court queuing and player ratings. We hope that someday our app will make a positive impact on a pickleball community's efficiency and well-being.
